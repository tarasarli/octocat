Hi! I'm Tara Sarli.

- I'm a Junior at BU double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology!
- I'm interested in learning everything tech related and applying my skillset to help people :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:!


- Fun facts: 
  1. I can speak almost 6 languages.
  2. If you see me with my earphones in, I'm probably listening to either Charles Aznavour or Edith Piaf.
  3. I am currently building up my skillset to help with the technical side of Domestic Violence Shelters' websites in the Boston area. 
  4. I'm Turkish-American!
